## How to install the application

`yarn install` and `yarn start`

We're fetching JSONs from AWS s3 bucket. In development environment we're using `localstack` that emulates AWS services.

You need to have docker-compose installed, then run:

`docker-compose -f localstack-docker-compose.yml up`

or

`docker-compose -f localstack-docker-compose.yml up -d` to run in background.

Then you need to create bucket `local-bucket`

`aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4572 s3 mb s3://local-bucket`

`aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4572 s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket local-bucket --acl public-read`

If service is running, application should properly fetch JSONs from faked s3.

You can use localstack with AWS CLI or SDK. You just need to add `--endpoint-url=http://localhost:4572` option.

Example:
`aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4572  s3 ls s3://local-bucket/`
